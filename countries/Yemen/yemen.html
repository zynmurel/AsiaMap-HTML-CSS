        <p>Yemen is located in the Middle East, along the Gulf of Aden to the south and the Red Sea to the west. It borders just 2 countries including Oman to the east and Saudi Arabia to the north. Yemen is known for its ancient kingdoms, large desert, and being the origin of coffee. Sanaa is the capital and largest city of Yemen. But since 2015, Aden has been the temporary capital and is one of the world’s oldest continuously inhabited cities. Other major cities are Al Hudaydah, Ta’izz, and Mukalla.</p>

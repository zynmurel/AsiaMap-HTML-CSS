        <p>Russia is located in both North Asia and Europe. It is the largest country in terms of its landmass in the world at over 17 million square kilometers (6.6 million sq mi). Altogether, this accounts for more than one-eighth of Earth’s inhabited land area. In fact, it’s so large that it crosses eleven different time zones. Russia is situated along the Arctic Ocean bordering both Europe to the east and Asia to the south. It borders 14 countries, which is the most out of any other country in the world. It includes Azerbaijan, Belarus, China, Estonia, Finland, Georgia, Kazakhstan, North Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Mongolia, Norway, Poland, and Ukraine. Moscow is the capital and largest city in Russia. But Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, and Yekaterinburg are other major cities.

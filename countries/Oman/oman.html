        <p> Oman is a country in the Arabian Peninsula and is the oldest independent state in the Arab world. It borders 3 other countries including the United Arab Emirates to the northwest, Saudi Arabia to the west, and Yemen to the southwest. Also, it shares a coastline with both the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea of 3,165 kilometers (1,967 mi). Its geographic position in the Persian Gulf makes Oman a hub for both trading and commerce. Itâ€™s also known for its oil reserves, meteorites, mosques, wadis, and long-serving rulers. Muscat is the capital and largest city. Other major cities are Seeb, Salalah, and Bawshar.

        <p>Turkmenistan is located in Central Asia, next to the Caspian Sea which is the world’s largest inland body of water. It borders Kazakhstan to the north, Uzbekistan to the northeast, Afghanistan to the southeast, and Iran to the southwest. Its coastline along the Caspian Sea measures 1,768 kilometers (1,100 mi) in length. It’s known for its gas reserves, underdevelopment, carpets, and horses. Additionally, it’s recognized as the “crossroads of civilizations” because the historic silk road runs through Turkmenistan. Ashgabat is the capital and largest city. Other major cities are Türkmenabat, Daşoguz, and Mary.</p>

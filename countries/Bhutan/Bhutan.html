        <p>Bhutan is a landlocked country located in Southern Asia on the eastern edge of the Himalayas. It borders just 2 countries with China located to the north and India to the south. Although both Nepal and Bangladesh are near Bhutan, these countries don’t actually share a border. The origin of the name “Bhutan” is “Land of the Thunder Dragon”. This is derived from the thunderous storms that occur in Bhutan due to the Great Himalayas Range. Although Bhutan is known to measure national happiness, it still ranks relatively due to its poverty. </p>

        <p>Thailand is in the heart of Southeastern Asia, along the Gulf of Thailand. It borders four Asian countries including Myanmar to the west, Laos to the north, Cambodia to the east, and Malaysia to the south. The country was originally known as Siam until its name changed in 1939 to Thailand (Land of the Free). There are 35,000 temples throughout Thailand and itâ€™s one of the most visited countries in the world with 16 million visitors each year. The capital and largest city of Thailand is Bangkok. Other major cities are Samut Prakan, Mueang Nonthaburi, and Udon Thani.</p>

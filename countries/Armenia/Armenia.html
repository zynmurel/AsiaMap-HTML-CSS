        <p>Armenia is a landlocked country located in the Middle East. But it can also be considered geopolitically part of Europe as well. Yerevan is the capital and largest city of Armenia. It borders 4 other countries. Turkey is located to the east. Whereas Azerbaijan is to the east. While Georgia is to the north, Iran is situated to the south. The Armenia boundary line is one of the most complex in the world today. For example, the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic is an exclave of Azerbaijan that borders Armenia to the southwest. Then, Artsvashen and Nagornoâ€“Karabakh are enclaves that Armenia claims within Azerbaijan.  On the contrary, Azerbaijan claimed 4 enclaves within Armenia including Yukhari Askipara, Yaradullu, Barxudarli, and Karki.</p>

        <p>The State of Palestine consists of two separate regions â€“ the Gaza Strip and West Bank.  Both regions are mostly surrounded by Israel. But the Gaza Strip borders Egypt to the west and West Bank is next to Jordan to the east, separated by the Jordan River. Overall, the State of Palestine does not have a capital city and its legal status is in question from a wide variety of viewpoints. Its major populated places include Gaza, East Jerusalem, Khan Yunis, Ramallah, and Jericho.</p>

        <p>Bahrain is an island located in the Persian Gulf next to Qatar in the east and Saudi Arabia to the west. The landmass is relatively small in size at 760 square kilometers (290 square miles). This makes it about 3.5 times the size of Washington, DC. The Bahrain archipelago consists of 70 natural islands and 33 artificial islands. Bahrain Island is the primary landmass making up around 83 percent of the country’s area. Although it’s not connected to its neighboring countries by land, the King Fahd Causeway connects Bahrain to Saudi Arabia.</p>

        <p>Brunei (Brunei Darussalam) is a small country on the island of Borneo, completely surrounded by Malaysia. It also shares a coastline with the South China Sea to the north for about 161 kilometers (100 mi). Brunei is split into two non-contiguous sections. First, the western section is more populous and made up of three districts including Belait, Tutong, and Brunei-Muara. Despite having the smallest area, the Brunei-Muara District is the most populous with approximately 70% of people living there. It also contains Bruneiâ€™s capital city of Bandar Seri Begawan, situated in the northeast region. Finally, the eastern section of Brunei is the Temburong District.</p>

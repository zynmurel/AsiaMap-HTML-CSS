        <p>Japan is a chain of islands located in Eastern Asia in the North Pacific Ocean. There are an estimated 6,800 islands in the entire archipelago of Japan. But its 4 main islands are Honshu, Kyushu, Hokkaido and Shikoku. First, Honshu is home to major cities like Tokyo (Japanâ€™s capital and largest city), Yokohama, Osaka, Kyoto, and Kobe. Secondly, Kyushu is its southwesternmost main island situated near the Korean Peninsula (South Korea). Next, Hokkaido is the northernmost main island known for its colder climate. Finally, Shikoku is the smallest of the four main islands and is separated by the Inner Sea from the rest of Japan. But some consider Okinawa as the fifth main island, which has a more tropical climate.</p>

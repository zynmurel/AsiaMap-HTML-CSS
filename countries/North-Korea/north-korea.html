        <p>North Korea, also known as the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), is a country in Eastern Asia located along the East Sea (Sea of Japan). It is an isolated country and is tightly controlled by its totalitarian leaders. It borders both China and Russia to the north. The 250-kilometer long Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) splits the Korean Peninsula in half, crossing the 38th parallel, with South Korea to the south. Pyongyang is the capital and largest city of North Korea. Other major cities include Hamhung, Namp’o, and Sunch’ŏn.</p>

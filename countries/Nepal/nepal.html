        <p>Nepal is a landlocked country in Southern Asia. Itâ€™s known for being the birthplace of Buddha, the Himalayas, and being home to the tallest mountain in the world, Mount Everest. It borders just three countries including China and Tibet to the north as well as India to the south. Also, it narrowly borders Bangladesh to the southeast by the Siliguri Corridor which separates the two countries. Kathmandu is the capital and largest city in Nepal. But its other major cities include Pokhara, Patan, and Biratnagar.</p>

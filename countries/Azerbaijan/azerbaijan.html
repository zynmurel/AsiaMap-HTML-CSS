        <p>Azerbaijan is a landlocked country along the coastline of the Caspian Sea to the east. It borders four other countries.  Both the countries of Georgia and Russia are to the north. Whereas Iran is situated to the south. Finally, Armenia is to the west, which forms a very complex country boundary. For instance, the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic is an exclave of Azerbaijan that borders Armenia to the southwest. Then, Artsvashen and the Nagorno Karabakh Republic are enclaves that Armenia claims within Azerbaijan.  Similarly, Azerbaijan claims 4 enclaves within Armenia including Yukhari Askipara, Yaradullu, Barxudarli, and Karki.</p>

        <p>Kazakhstan is located in Central Asia, next to the Caspian Sea. It’s situated northwest of China and southwest of Russia. In the south, it also borders the countries of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan. Kazakhstan is the world’s largest landlocked country without any coastline. Despite its large size, it has one of the lowest population densities in the world. Within Kazakhstan, there is a 90-kilometer buffer, Baikonur Cosmodrome, that it leases to Russia as a space launch facility. It’s also home to the largest lake in the world in the southwest, the Caspian Sea. The capital is Nur-Sultan but the largest city is Almaty.</p>

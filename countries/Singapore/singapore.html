        <p>Singapore is an island country located in Southeastern Asia between the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea. The country occupies an area of just 728.6 square kilometers (281.3 sq mi), about 4 times larger than Washington, DC. Despite its small area, it’s still the world’s largest city-state. To the north, the Johore Strait separates Singapore from Malaysia. Whereas to the south, it’s the Singapore Strait that separates it from Indonesia. Singapore is known for its multiculturalism, cleanliness, nature, safety, tourism, and technology. The population in Singapore is concentrated in the center, with pockets along the southern coast. It also has the third-highest population density in the world, after Monaco and Macau. Because the country is a city-state, the capital of Singapore is Singapore.

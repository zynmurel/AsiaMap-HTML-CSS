        <p>Qatar is a peninsula in the Middle East, along the coast of the Persian Gulf. It borders only 1 country, which is Saudi Arabia to the southwest. But itâ€™s also close to Bahrain to the northwest and the United Arab Emirates to the southeast. Qatar is on its own peninsula, known as the Qatari Peninsula. But it also contains the islands of Pearl-Qatar, Al Safliya, and Al Aaliya. Doha is the capital and largest city of Qatar to the east along the Persian Gulf. The physical location of Qatar makes it a central location for major oil and natural gas deposits and exchange. This is why petroleum resources have become a major economic engine and source of employment in Qatar.</p>

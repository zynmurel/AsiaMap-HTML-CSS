        <p>Cambodia is located in Southeast Asia. It borders just 2 other countries. First, Vietnam wraps around Cambodia from the south all the way around to the northeast. Secondly, Thailand is situated to the north of Cambodia. Also, its coastline is heavily indented by the Gulf of Thailand with a length of about 443 km (275 mi). Cambodia is world-renowned for its temples with over 4000 locations throughout the country. Perhaps, one of the most recognized is Angkor Wat, which is the largest religious monument in the world. Phnom Penh is the capital and largest city of Cambodia, as well as its economic, industrial, and cultural center.</p>
